<p>You've probably noticed a striking similarity between the Windows 7 icon bar and the Mac OS X Dock. However, one of the main differences is that while the Mac Dock is centered on the screen, the Windows dock is arranged from left to right.</p>
<p><b>TaskDock</b> is an application that allows you to move icons from the Windows 7 taskbar and place them in the center of the screen if you want.</p>
<p>When you launch the program, you will see an icon on the taskbar. When you click on it, the program gives you the option to center the taskbar icons. Then you simply place the green arrow in the center of the bar and double-click on it.</p>
<p>If you want to return the icons to their original positions, all you have to do is close the program using the same icon on the taskbar.</p>
<p>It may not be a very traditional way, but TaskDock is one of the most effective options for customizing the position of icons on the new Windows 7 taskbar.</p>
